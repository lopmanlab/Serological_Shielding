This folder contains code files used to simulate the model at the MLE for each location (SFloridaOpening_SamplePlots_ak.R, WashingtonOpening_SamplePlots_ak.R, 
NYCOpening_SamplePlots_ak.R).  These three files take 2021-06-17.csv as an input.  When run, these three code files generate Rdata sets, that are used as an input to make plots that 
combine the files from all three locations (comb_figs_nov2020_ak.R). 

The site-specific R scripts each take about 5 minutes to run (3 seconds per model run with 97 scenarios run per site).
