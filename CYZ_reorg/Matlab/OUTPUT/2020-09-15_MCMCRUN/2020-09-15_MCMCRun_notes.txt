- This run lasted from 09-15 to 09-19-2020
- Computation took ~4 days to complete, but b/c I was using my laptop instead of my desktop
- Goal was to compare LL, SS, and SSpen penalties (SSpen includes a sero penalty)
	- LL = poisson log likelhiood
	- SS = sum of squares error
	- SSpen = sum of sq including a seroprevalence error
	- All three have an R0 penalty included already
- SCALING
	- SSpen heavily weights sero data
		- Sero penalty is coded as absolute prevalence (# people rather than %)
			- Calculated as seroprev% * popsize
			- Then, used sum of squares error
		- This is also only for a single datapoint
			- Endpoint of the sero study
			- Only the mean
	- Can change to include a range of dates and seroprevalences
		- NEXTSTEP: Likely onyl change to include the 95% CI
		- NEXTSTEP: Seroprev penalty outside the CI?
	- Need to change to "equal weighting"
		- How?
			- Switch to %'s
			- Hard set scaling factors?
- Plot saving is weird
	- Original plan was to get data & transfer to R for visualizations
	- Means saving .mat files as .csv's.
