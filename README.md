# Serological_Shielding

This folder contains code used to build a model of serological shielding, which explores the impacts of using an imperfect
serological test to inform social distancing policies at a population scale. We use an SEIR-like transmission model structure
and examine the impact of policy changes relating to both relaxing social distancing measures and testing on cumulative deaths,
the number of people released from national social distancing, and US health system burden.

Code to run the overall transmission model as a sweep is located in the code file 'Sweep_CalibratedModel_knnfigedits.R' and  code for naive social distancing simulations is located in 'SD_Simulations.R'.
