This folder contains code used to generate credible intervals for effect estimates of shielding, based on the final states of the MCMC chains.

sample.params.R - code to randomly select parameter sets from the end of each MCMC chain 
sample.params.2.csv - randomly selected parameter sets
Opening_CredInt_AllLocs_0709.R - simulates the ODE model for the parameter sets selected from the end of the MCMC chain, used to get uncertainty intervals, uses sample.params.2.csv as an input
and creates an output Rdata file with model simulation results for each run (not uploaded due to size) 
CredInt_Summaries.R  - summarizes credible interval characteristics by site, uses the Rdata file from Opening_CredInt_AllLocs_0709.R as an input.  This code file
produces the credible intervals used in the paper

Run times: 
The code files sample.params.R and CredInt_Summaries.R both run very quickly (less than 1 minute).  
The Opening_CredInt_AllLocs_0709.R file takes ~3 seconds per model run with 1600 model runs per site.  Therefore, generating credible intervals takes approximately 
80 minutes per site, or 4 hours total for all sites combined without any computer parallelization.
