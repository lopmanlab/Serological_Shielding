This folder contains code files used to simulate the model at the MLE for each location (WashOpening_addvax.R, nycOpening_addvax.R, SflorOpening_addvax.R) assuming a vaccination rate of 0.5% of the population per day starting on January 1, 2021. 
We assume a vaccine efficacy of 95%: vaccinated, protected individuals (95% of vaccinees) are moved from the untested compartments to the tested, recovered (R) compartment and vaccinated, 
unprotected persons (5% of vaccinees), are placed in the tested, susceptible (S) compartment. This represents an “all-or-nothing” vaccine, whereby vaccinated
persons receive complete protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease. When run, these three code files generate Rdata sets. 
We analyze the total number of deaths ine each location using code in vaxmodelresults081121.R.  These results are summarized in Table S4.

These code files take 2021-06-17_MLEs.csv as input data (available under the MLE_sims folder in this repository).  
Each of the site-specific code files runs in approximately 10-15 minutes.
